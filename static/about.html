            <p class="sn-pro"> Our offical mission is the following: A non-profit which aims to give students in
                poorer areas, or who do not have access/the knowledge to get into things like hardware, engineering, and robotics, a
                cheap or free way to enter into the space. The program may include things such as a way to get free parts for underprivileged students and a cheap subscription-based model for those who just need some way to get in easily. There
                would also be free guides for both students and adults looking to get into things like what I mentioned earlier. </p>

          <div>
            <p class="sn-pro"> Although in our mission it says that we aim to help students who are underprivileged, our eventual goal is to be able to provide electronics kits to any child who wants. </p>
